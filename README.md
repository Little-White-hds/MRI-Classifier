AlzheimerClassifier
=========

# Introduction

Thank you for using our AlzheimerClassifier software. This user guide is intended for all
the users which want to learn how to use the AlzheimerClassifier tool for classifying MRI
patient brain scans based on the patient's pathology (i.e., AD, CN, LMCI, MCI).

# Input/Output

The AlzheimerClassifier software package takes as input the MRI patient brain scans
(i.e., for ADNI the *.nii files, for OASIS the *.hdr and *.img files). In the case, you
have your own image files, the image formats supported by our software are:

  - Windows Bitmaps (*.bmp, *.dib)
  - JPEG files (*.jpeg, *.jpg, *.jpe)
  - JPEG 2000 files (*.jp2)
  - Portable Network Graphics (*.png)
  - Portable image format (*.pbm, *.pgm, *.ppm)
  - Sun rasters (*.sr, *.ras)
  - TIFF files (*.tiff, *.tif)

The software provides as output a set of CSV files, each one having a possible combination
of patient's disease (e.g., ADvsCN, ADvsCNvsMCI, CNvsMCI, ...). These files can be used with
Weka to perform the classification task, setting the desidered parameters of the classifier
chosen. We found that LIBSVM is the most performing classifier for this kind of task.

# Download

In the case you downloaded empty directories here the solution to fix your problem. Since
the Github repository contains sub-modules you need to recursively download it by typing
the following command:
  
        - cd <AlzheimerClassifier-root>
        - cd ..
        - rm -rf AlzheimerClassifier
        - git clone --recursive https://github.com/fabioprev/AlzheimerClassifier

While for pulling the latest modifications to any of the sub-modules, type in the terminal:
  
        - cd <AlzheimerClassifier-root>
        - git pull
        - git submodule foreach git pull origin master

# Usage

Running the software is easy and straightforward. We now describe a quick guide on how to
use the software, but a specific guide for each software package can be found in the
README.md file contained in the root directory of the software package.

<b>Data set organization</b>

   We first need to organize the images we want to use according to the patient's categories (i.e., AD,
   CN, LMCI, MCI). For the ADNI and OASIS data sets, we provide the DatasetOrganizer tool to do this
   task automatically. You have to type the following command in a terminal:
   
        - cd <DatasetOrganizer-root>/bin
        - ./DatasetOrganizer -d <directory-root>
   
   In the case you have your own image data set, then you have to create a directory tree like the
   following one containing MRI image files in directories divided by patient's class:
   
        - <MyOwnDataSet>
          - <Class_1>
            MRI_Patient_1
            MRI_Patient_2
            MRI_Patient_3
            ...
            MRI_Patient_N
          - <Class_2>
            MRI_Patient_1
            MRI_Patient_2
            MRI_Patient_3
            ...
            MRI_Patient_M
          - ...
          - <Class_J>
            MRI_Patient_1
            MRI_Patient_2
            MRI_Patient_3
            ...
            MRI_Patient_W

<b>MRI image extraction (mandatory only for ADNI and OASIS)</b>

Afterwards, we have to extract the MRI patient brain scans from the data we organized.
We therefore use the ImageExtractor software package to do this task. The code has been
developed by using Matlab R2012b but the code should be compatible also with newer Matlab
versions. Open Matlab and import the ImageExtractor software package. Then type the
following command:

        - imageExtractor(<dataset-name>,<dataset-path>) - e.g., imageExtractor('adni','/home/fabio/IASI-CNR/Datasets/ADNI/')

3. Now we are ready to extract ORB features from the patient MRI scans and to generate the
   CSV files for the classifier algorithm. Remember to set the correct parameters of the
   algorithm before running the code (see README.md in FeatureExtractor). Once the parameters
   have been set type the following command:
   
        - cd <FeatureExtractor>/bin
        - ./FeatureExtractor -d <directory-root>

4. If features have been correctly extracted from the MRI scans you should find a directory
   called 'ClassPatientFiles' in the root directory of the data set chosen. Now, before using
   the CSV files with Weka, we need to generate a set of CSV files, each one having a possible
   combination of patient's disease (e.g., ADvsCN, ADvsCNvsMCI, CNvsMCI, ...). In order to do
   so, we type in the terminal the following command:
   
        - cd <AlzheimerClassifier-root>/scripts
        - cd <dataset-chosen> (e.g., ADNI or OASIS)
        - ./generateClassifierFiles.sh <dataset-root> <section> [ <section> ... <section> ]
   
   After this procedure you should find a directory called 'ClassifierFiles' in the root directory
   of the data set chosen.

5. The last step is open Weka, set the desidered parameters of the classifier and run it
   using one of the file generated at the previous point. We found that LIBSVM is the most
   performing classifier for this kind of task.
