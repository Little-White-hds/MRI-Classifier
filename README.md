AlzheimerClassifier
=========

Thank you for using our AlzheimerClassifier software. In the case you downloaded two empty
directiories here the solution to fix your problem. Since the Github repository contains two
sub-modules you need to recursively download it by typing the following command:

  - git clone --recursive https://github.com/fabioprev/AlzheimerClassifier

While for pulling the latest modifications to any of the sub-modules, type in the terminal:

  - cd <AlzheimerClassifier-root>
  - git submodule foreach git pull origin master

For any problem/question/suggestion please send an email to previtali@dis.uniroma1.it and
we will be glad to help you!
